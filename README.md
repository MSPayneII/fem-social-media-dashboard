## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

**I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to do this challenge.**

## The challenge

Build out this Social Media Dashboard and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

## Your users can:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Toggle color theme to their preference
